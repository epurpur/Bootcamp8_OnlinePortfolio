# Bootcamp8_OnlinePortfolio

Now that I've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, I'll be updating my portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

## My Portfolio Items

## Note for Grader
I know I did not follow outline for required items in my portfolio exactly. I liked the way my portfolio looked so I changed things accordingly.
